## Game State Flow

```
CLI Parse → Init Game → Main Loop → Cleanup
              ↓            ↓
         game_state_t   Determine Player Type
              ↓            ↓
         Init Caches   Human Input or AI Search
              ↓            ↓
         Init Board    Make Move → Update State
                          ↓
                     Check Win/Draw → Continue or End
```

## AI Architecture Details

### Search Strategy

The AI uses a carefully tuned minimax search with several layers of optimization:

1. **Iterative Deepening**: Searches progressively deeper, stopping on timeout
2. **Move Generation**: Scans board directly, generates candidates within radius 2
3. **Move Ordering**: Sorts moves by priority (wins first, then threats, then heuristics)
4. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Eliminates provably inferior branches
5. **Transposition Table**: Avoids re-searching identical positions
6. **Killer Moves**: Prioritizes moves that caused cutoffs at same depth

### Evaluation Function

Position scoring combines multiple factors:

- **Threat Recognition**: Pattern matching for tactical features
  - Five-in-a-row: 100,000 (winning position)
  - Straight four: 50,000 (critical threat)
  - Open three: 1,000 (strong attack)
  - Lower threats: Progressively smaller scores

- **Pattern Combinations**: Bonus for multiple threats
  - Three-and-four: 5,000
  - Three-and-three: 5,000
  - Multiple threats amplify position strength

- **Positional Factors**:
  - Center control bias
  - Stone connectivity
  - Space control

### Performance Characteristics

**Typical Performance** (15x15 board, depth 4):

- Opening moves: 1-2 seconds
- Mid-game: 2-5 seconds
- End-game: <1 second (fewer candidates)

**Search Statistics**:

- Nodes evaluated: 10K-100K depending on position
- Branching factor: ~40 average (reduced by radius constraint)
- Transposition hits: 20-40% of probes
- Alpha-beta cutoffs: 60-80% of branches

## Testing Infrastructure

### Running Tests

```bash
# Setup (first time only)
make googletest

# Run all tests
make test

# Alternative: CMake build
make cmake-test
```

**Test Coverage**: Core game logic, AI algorithms, edge cases, and integration scenarios.

## Build System

### Make Build (Traditional)

```bash
make build        # Build game executable
make test         # Build and run tests
make clean        # Remove build artifacts
make rebuild      # Clean + build
```

**Compiler Flags**:

- Optimized build: `-O3`
- Warnings: `-Wall -Wextra -Wimplicit-function-declaration`
- Test build: `-O2` (faster compilation)

### CMake Build (Modern)

```bash
make cmake-build  # Build with CMake
make cmake-test   # Test with CMake
make cmake-clean  # Clean CMake build
```

**Features**:

- Out-of-source builds in `build/` directory
- Automatic Google Test discovery
- Cross-platform support

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Unified Move Generation

**Rationale**: Eliminated dual-path complexity (optimized vs dynamic) that caused maintenance burden and potential bugs. Single direct board scanning approach is simpler and more maintainable.

**Benefits**:

- Single source of truth
- No cache synchronization issues
- Naturally adapts to board changes
- Easier to understand and debug

### 2. Simplified Threat Evaluation

**Rationale**: Removed complex open-end tracking that added code complexity without proportional benefit. Simple consecutive-count scoring is sufficient for move ordering.

**Trade-off**: Slightly less precise tactical evaluation, but much simpler code. The minimax search compensates by evaluating actual positions.

### 3. Transposition Table Without Clearing

**Rationale**: Keeping entries across moves improves hit rate. Depth-based replacement ensures fresh entries replace stale ones naturally.

**Impact**: Better search efficiency without the overhead of clearing 100K entries between moves.

### 4. Modular Architecture

**Rationale**: Clean separation allows independent testing and development. Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Benefit**: New features (like game modes) can be added without touching AI code. Bug fixes are isolated to specific modules.

### 5. Dynamic Player Type System

**Rationale**: Enables three game modes with minimal code duplication. Runtime player type determination keeps code flexible.

**Implementation**: Player type arrays indexed by player constant. Game loop queries type before each turn.

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Memory Efficiency

- Stack-based move arrays (no heap allocation in search)
- Compact data structures (bit flags, unsigned char for small values)
- Reusable buffers (candidate maps, move lists)

### CPU Efficiency

- Early loop exits on bounds/empty checks
- Candidate map for O(1) duplicate detection
- Incremental hash updates (O(1) vs O(board_size²))
- Sorted move lists for faster cutoffs

### Search Efficiency

- Radius constraint (radius 2) limits branching factor
- Killer move heuristics improve move ordering
- Transposition table avoids redundant search
- Iterative deepening finds good moves early

## Extension Points

The modular design provides clear extension points for new features:
