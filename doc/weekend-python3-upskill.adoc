= Weekend Python 3 Upskilling Plan
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Learning Goals

* Map existing Ruby, C, Bash, and JavaScript knowledge to Python 3 core syntax and idioms.
* Adopt modern "Pythonic" constructs including type hints, dataclasses, pattern matching, asyncio, and packaging best practices.
* Reinforce concepts with compact, hands-on exercises for each topic.

== Day 0 (Friday Evening): Setup & Orientation

=== Environment

* Install Python 3.11 or newer.
* Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv ~/pyweekend && source ~/pyweekend/bin/activate`.
* Install helpful tooling: `pip install ipython black pytest mypy`.

=== Quick Syntax Alignment (1 hr)

* Review indentation-driven blocks, significant whitespace, and module structure.
* Compare Python functions, list and dict literals, slicing, and truthiness with Ruby and C.

[.exercise]
====
Write `hello.py` that prints a greeting using `print(f"Hello, {name}")`, prompting for the name with `input()`.
====

== Day 1 Morning: Core Language & Data Structures

=== Pythonic Syntax & Flow Control (1.5 hrs)

* `if`/`elif`/`else`, `for` loops over iterables, `while`, `break`, and `continue`.
* Multiple assignment, tuple unpacking, `enumerate`, and `zip`.
* Truthiness rules where empty sequences evaluate to `False`.

[.exercise]
====
Re-implement FizzBuzz using tuple unpacking and a list comprehension to generate the output sequence.
====

=== Built-in Collections & Comprehensions (1.5 hrs)

* `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`, `collections.Counter`, and `defaultdict`.
* List, dict, and set comprehensions; generator expressions for lazy evaluation.
* Built-in helpers such as `any`, `all`, `sum`, and `sorted` with key functions.

[.exercise]
====
Given logs of games, build a frequency table with `Counter` and transform it with a dict comprehension.
====

== Day 1 Afternoon: Functions, Types, & Modules

=== Functions & Functional Tools (1.5 hrs)

* Default and keyword arguments, `*args`, and `**kwargs`.
* First-class functions, `map`, `filter`, and `functools.partial`.
* Lambdas versus named functions and the basics of decorators.

[.exercise]
====
Create a decorator that measures execution time and apply it to an algorithm of your choice.
====

=== Type Hints & Dataclasses (1.5 hrs)

* `typing` basics such as `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `Callable`, and `Protocol`.
* Philosophy of gradual typing compared to static typing in C.
* `@dataclass`, frozen dataclasses, default factories, and `slots=True`.

[.exercise]
====
Define a `@dataclass` for a Gomoku move, annotate relevant functions, and run `mypy` to check types.
====

== Day 1 Evening: Files, Exceptions, Context Managers

* Exception hierarchy, `try`/`except`/`else`/`finally`, and creating custom exceptions.
* Context managers with `with`, implementing via `contextlib` or `__enter__`/`__exit__` methods.
* File I/O with `pathlib.Path`, JSON handling, and a brief look at YAML.

[.exercise]
====
Build a log reader that safely opens a file, parses JSON lines, and catches malformed entries gracefully.
====

== Day 2 Morning: Object Orientation & Pattern Matching

=== Classes & Protocols (1.5 hrs)

* Class definitions, instance versus class variables, and private naming conventions.
* Inheritance versus composition, `super()`, and mixins.
* Duck typing and structural subtyping with `typing.Protocol`.

[.exercise]
====
Implement a board renderer protocol and two concrete classes (text and ANSI) that demonstrate polymorphism.
====

=== Pattern Matching (1 hr)

* Structural pattern matching with `match`/`case`, guards, and sequence or dict patterns.
* Comparisons with Ruby `case` statements and JavaScript destructuring.

[.exercise]
====
Use `match` to interpret user commands (`place`, `undo`, etc.) for a CLI application.
====

== Day 2 Midday: Iterables, Generators, Async

=== Iterators & Generators (1.5 hrs)

* Iterator protocol, `iter`, and `next`.
* Generator functions, `yield from`, and generator-based pipelines.
* Essentials from `itertools` for efficient iteration patterns.

[.exercise]
====
Create a generator that produces Gomoku winning-line candidates and chain it with `itertools` helpers.
====

=== Asyncio & Concurrency (1.5 hrs)

* Event loop basics, `async def`, `await`, and distinguishing tasks from threads or processes.
* `asyncio.gather`, async context managers, and cancellation handling.
* Contrasts with Node.js async patterns and Ruby fibers.

[.exercise]
====
Write an async fetcher (simulating I/O with `asyncio.sleep`) that concurrently validates moves.
====

== Day 2 Afternoon: Packaging, Testing, Tooling

=== Modules, Packages & Environments (1 hr)

* Module import system, `__init__.py`, and relative versus absolute imports.
* `pip`, `pyproject.toml`, and an overview of `setuptools` versus `poetry`.
* Use of `pip-tools` or `poetry` for reproducible dependency management.

[.exercise]
====
Package a mini library named `gomoku_utils` with a `pyproject.toml` and install it locally for testing.
====

=== Testing & Tooling (1.5 hrs)

* `pytest` basics, fixtures, and parametrization.
* Doctests and property-based testing with `hypothesis`.
* Formatting with `black`, linting with `ruff`, and static typing with `mypy`.

[.exercise]
====
Write a `pytest` suite for board evaluation functions, run `pytest`, add type hints, and run `mypy`.
====

== Day 2 Evening: Capstone & Reflection

* Combine learnings into a small CLI Gomoku helper that:
** Parses moves from a file using context managers and dataclasses.
** Evaluates board state using generators and comprehensions.
** Offers interactive commands with `match` pattern matching.
** Includes tests, type hints, and a `pyproject.toml` for packaging.
* Optional stretch goal: expose an async API to evaluate multiple boards concurrently.

=== Reflection Checklist

* Which Python features feel most different from Ruby or C?
* Where do type hints help or hinder productivity?
* How does Python's standard library support rapid scripting compared to Ruby or JavaScript?

== Additional Resources

* link:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/[Official Python Tutorial] (focus on Data Structures, Classes, Errors and Exceptions, and Virtual Environments and Packages).
* "Fluent Python" (2nd Edition) chapters covering the data model, typing, and concurrency.
* link:https://realpython.com/[Real Python] articles on asyncio, dataclasses, and pattern matching.
* link:https://python-patterns.guide/[python-patterns.guide] for idiomatic Python insights.

== Tips for Success

* Use IPython or `python -i` for quick experimentation, similar to IRB.
* Translate familiar Ruby scripts into Python to reinforce idioms.
* Keep `pydoc` and `help()` handy; Python's introspection is powerful.
* Leverage list and dict comprehensions alongside the standard library before reaching for external packages.
